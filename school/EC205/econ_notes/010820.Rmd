[*Economy*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economy.asp) - The economy is the mechanism through which resource use is organized to satisfy the desires of people living together in a society.

In a economy decisions must be made to determine:

  1. **WHAT** will be produced
  2. **HOW** will it be produced
  3. **TO WHOM** will it be distributed

### The process of production

Inputs -> Production -> Outputs

**Capital**: Means to produce goods


## Economic Models

* An economic model is a means of explaining how a sector of the economy functions.*

Models consist of:

  1. Economic Variables
  2. Assumptions
  3. Implications

Economic models are abstractions that use logic to establish cause-and-effect  relationships among economic variables.

## Production Possibility Curve

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width = '40%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F6%2F67%2FProduction_Possibilities_Frontier_Curve.svg%2F1200px-Production_Possibilities_Frontier_Curve.svg.png&f=1&nofb=1")
```

Because some resources are specialized, the opportunity cost of each additional unit of output increases as more of a good is produced over a given period.

The "bowed in" shape of the production possibilities curve reflects the law of increasing costs.
